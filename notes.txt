Notes on CNN and Retro
Use the env.render() to grab the environment img in RGB format and put into numpy array and then plot with MatplotLib
try var.shape() - I think this gets the size of the array output by the env
Image shape is the input shape for the CNN, then the output shape is the input shape for the next layer

Debugging:
At the end of a match grab the play time variable

ToDo This Week:
Add all altered files to Github folder

Get image data from frames
- Preprocess to Grey-scale, see if we need RGB or not
- Crop and view data using matplotlib to check captured regions

Format the game folder structure in retro/data/stable:
- rom file
- scenario.json
- metadata.json
- startingPoint.state
- Get different states for Player vs Stage 1 CPU, Player vs Player, Player vs Stage 3 CPU

Create CNN network structure in OpenAI Gym
- Use Tensorflow library to create structure
- Check that the inputs and outputs for each layer work, and the activation functions are set correctly
- Set filter sizes correctly

Finish draft of google surveys for SUS and General Feedback
- Check how to evaluate custom SUS surveys
- Think up good general feedback based around emotions during play, difficulty and the overall experience


Image size for Airstriker - 224x320x3
